# 🤖 Esvin: WTH Agentic AI (Agent-to-Agent in Microsoft Azure)

This project explores the design and implementation of a **multi-agent system** that autonomously monitors cloud infrastructure, detects anomalies, optimizes resource usage, and coordinates actions through **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** communication. Built on **Microsoft Azure**, the system leverages **graph-based workflows** to enable intelligent, distributed decision-making across specialized agents.

## 🔧 Core Agents

- **🛰️ Monitor Agent**  
  Continuously observes cloud metrics and service health.

- **📉 Anomaly Detector**  
  Identifies unusual patterns using statistical or ML models.

- **⚙️ Resource Optimizer**  
  Recommends or triggers scaling actions to improve efficiency.

- **🚨 Alert Manager**  
  Notifies stakeholders and initiates remediation workflows.

## 🔁 Agentic Communication

Agents collaborate via **A2A protocols**, sharing insights and delegating tasks to maintain system resilience and performance.
